# odin-recipes
This is a really basic recipes site for a project in the odin project.

This site has a main page and links to a few recipes. It is made for the
recipes project in the foundations course in The Odin Project.

It is one of my first webpage projects and only contains some really simple
html code (no css or javascript) so don't have high (or medium)
expectations.
